/**
 * The email a new staff member receives instead of "Reset Password Notification",
 * which reads oddly to someone who has never had an account.
 *
 * The link is built by ResetPassword::createUrlUsing() in AppServiceProvider, so
 * this class does not override resetUrl(). That keeps one source of truth for the
 * URL and, more importantly, keeps it panel-independent: a staff member whose
 * role changes between invitation and reset can still set their password.
 *
 * Deliberately NOT ShouldQueue, unlike Filament ResetPassword: the queue runs on
 * the database connection here, so a queued invitation would sit unsent until a
 * worker happened to be running, while the admin was told it had gone.
